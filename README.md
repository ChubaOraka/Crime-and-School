**Introduction**

This is project that aims to investigate whether there is a relationship between public education and crime rate. While this project focuses mainly on crime, it is intended to form part of a gestalt of projects investigating the impact of education on society. The hypothesis behind my study on the impact of education on society is that education increases opportunity for upward mobility in the social ladder. This implies improved access to good quality education should have an impact on wealth crearion, health and general wellbeing of members of society. However, good quality education costs money. The high cost of good quality education acts as a barrier for people born in poverty and, in my opinion, is a significant contributor to generational poverty.

In a society where public education has become a political football, subject to the caprice of budgeting and sequestration and not drawing the same level of commitment that defense spending does from ideologues, this project aims to highlight the importance of public education to the societal advancement.
